  4. If >1 entry alive but no weeks left → split equally among entries with valid final-week submissions (Rule 19d).
- **Official after Week 8:** If NFL season lasts <8 weeks, refunds; ≥8 weeks with incomplete season → remaining entries split prize. 90-day suspension rule covers long pauses (Rule 20 & 20a).
